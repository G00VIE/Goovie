# Goovie

Goovie is a cross-platform CLI tool built in Go that lets you search and stream movies, shows, and anime directly from your terminal. It bridges your local Prowlarr instance with `webtorrent` and `mpv` to deliver seamless, instant streaming without waiting for downloads to finish.

> [!TIP]
> **🌸 Anime lovers rejoice!** Anime streaming works completely out of the box with **zero setup required**. You don't even need Prowlarr for anime! Just open the app, search, and start watching.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running Goovie, ensure you have the following installed on your system. Each tool plays a specific role in making the magic happen!

1. **[Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com/)**: An indexer proxy/manager. Goovie uses this to search across all your configured torrent indexers at once.
2. **[WebTorrent CLI](https://webtorrent.io/)**: The streaming torrent client. This is what makes instant playback possible without waiting for full downloads.
3. **[MPV](https://mpv.io/)**: A highly capable, robust media player. Goovie pipes the stream directly into mpv for viewing.
4. **[Flaresolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) (Optional but Recommended)**: A proxy server to bypass Cloudflare protection. Useful if your indexers in Prowlarr are protected.

## 📦 Installation Guide

Here is a quick breakdown of how to install the prerequisites on each device!

### 🪟 Windows
You can use [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) (comes pre-installed on modern Windows) or Node.js.
- **Node.js (for WebTorrent)**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **WebTorrent**: Open command prompt and run `npm install -g webtorrent-cli`
- **MPV**: `winget install mpv`
- **Prowlarr / Flaresolverr**: Best installed via Docker (see Docker section below) or via their Windows installers.

### 🍎 macOS
You will need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the missing package manager for macOS. If you don't have it, run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` in your terminal.
- **WebTorrent**: `npm install -g webtorrent-cli` (Requires Node.js: `brew install node`)
- **MPV**: `brew install mpv`
- **Prowlarr / Flaresolverr**: Run via Docker or `brew install --cask prowlarr`

### 🐧 Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
Use your built-in package manager `apt` and Node.js.
- **WebTorrent**: `npm install -g webtorrent-cli` (Requires Node.js: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`)
- **MPV**: `sudo apt install mpv`
- **Prowlarr / Flaresolverr**: Run via Docker.

### 🐳 Docker (Prowlarr & Flaresolverr)
The cleanest way to run Prowlarr and Flaresolverr is via Docker. You can use tools like [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or standard Docker Engine.
Just grab their official images:
- `lscr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr:latest`
- `ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest`

## 🚀 App Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Download Pre-compiled Binaries
You can find pre-compiled binaries on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/G00VIE/Goovie/releases) page.
- Windows: `goovie-windows-amd64.exe`
- Linux: `goovie-linux-amd64`
- macOS (Intel): `goovie-darwin-amd64`
- macOS (Apple Silicon): `goovie-darwin-arm64`

**Note for Linux/macOS users:** After downloading, you will need to make the binary executable before you can run it:
```bash
chmod +x goovie-*
```

### Option 2: Build from Source
If you have Go installed (1.20+), you can easily build it yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/G00VIE/goovie.git
cd goovie
go build -o goovie ./cmd/goovie/
```

## ⚙️ Configuration & API Keys

Goovie needs to talk to Prowlarr to search for movies/shows. Here's how it connects:

1. **Auto-Detection (Magic! ✨)**: If you installed Prowlarr directly on your PC (Windows/Mac/Linux), Goovie will automatically find your `config.xml` file, extract the API key, and connect instantly! No manual setup needed.
2. **In-App Prompt**: If you run Prowlarr via Docker, Goovie won't be able to read inside the Docker container. Instead, the first time you run Goovie, it will gracefully prompt you in the terminal to paste your **Prowlarr API Key**. It then saves this in a local `~/.goovie/config.json` file for future use.
3. **Environment Variables**: For advanced users, you can bypass everything by setting environment variables manually:
   - `PROWLARR_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:9696`)
   - `PROWLARR_API_KEY`

## 🔍 Recommended Indexers (Prowlarr)

When setting up Prowlarr, we recommend adding the following popular public indexers to get the best search results for movies and shows:
- **1337x**
- **The Pirate Bay**
- **YTS**
- **LimeTorrents**
- **EZTV**
- **ShowRSS**
- **MagnetDL**

> [!WARNING]
> **Why do I need FlareSolverr?**
> Some of these indexers (like 1337x or The Pirate Bay) might be blocked by your ISP/DNS, or they might have aggressive Cloudflare "Checking your browser" protections. **FlareSolverr** acts as a proxy that automatically bypasses these Cloudflare checks so Prowlarr can successfully search them. If an indexer fails to connect in Prowlarr, route it through FlareSolverr!

---

## How it works (The Workflow)
1. **Search**: Enter the name of the movie or show into the beautiful terminal UI.
2. **Scrape**: Goovie concurrently queries all your active Prowlarr indexers using the API.
3. **Select**: Goovie aggregates the results and presents a clean list sorted by the number of seeders.
4. **Resolve**: Once you pick a torrent, Goovie resolves the proxy link into a raw `magnet:` URI or a `.torrent` file payload.
5. **Watch**: WebTorrent immediately buffers the media sequentially and pipes it directly into the MPV player.
